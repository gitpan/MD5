MD5 Extension
-------------

This is a Perl5 extension interface to the RSA Data Security Inc. MD5
Message Digest algorithm.

To build the extension, unpack this distribution somewhere, create the
Makefile using 'perl Makefile.PL' and do a 'make' and 'make install'.

The mddriver.pl script gives a simple example of how to use the
routines. In particular 'perl mddriver.pl -x' will perform a quick
test of the routines to see if they produce the expected output. The
use of "make test" will perform a more comprehensive test.

The module is known to work on at least Linux, AIX, Solaris, HP-UX and
IRIX. It should work on other "reasonable" UNIX-like platforms (for an
unspecified definition of the word "reasonable" :-)

Support is also provided for 64-bit platforms. This should be detected
and handled automatically. See the entry for version 1.7 in the
Changes file for further details.
