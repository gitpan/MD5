*** 96/03/14 Version 1.5.3

Fixed addfile method to accept type-glob references for the file-handle
(eg \*STDOUT). This is more consistent with other routines and is now the
recommended way of passing file-handles. The documentation now gives more
examples as to how the routines might be used.

*** 96/03/12 Version 1.5.2

Minor fixes from Christopher J Madsen <madsen@computek.net> to provide
support for building on OS/2 (and to work arround a perl -w bug).

Remove warning about possible difference between add('foo', 'bar') and
add('foobar'). This is not true (it may have been true in the earliest
version of the module but is no longer the case).

*** 96/03/08 Version 1.5.1

Add CHANGES file to make it easier for people to figure out what has
been going on. (Meant to do this as part of 1.5)

*** 96/03/05 Version 1.5

Add hash() and hexhash() methods at the suggestion/request of Gary
Howland <gary@kampai.euronet.nl> before inclusion in a wider library
of cryptography modules.

*** 96/02/27 Version 1.4

Finally fixed the pesky Solaris dynamic loading bug. All kudos to Ken
Pizzini <kenp@spry.com>!

*** 95/11/29 Version 1.3.1

Add explanations of current known problems.

*** 95/06/02 Version 1.3

Fix problems with scope resolution in addfile() reported by
Jean-Claude Giese <Jean-Claude.Giese@loria.fr>. Basically ARGV is
always implicitly in package main while other filehandles aren't.
