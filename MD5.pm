=head1 NAME

MD5 - Perl interface to the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MD5;
    
    $context = new MD5;
    $context->reset();
    
    $context->add(LIST);
    $context->addfile(HANDLE);
    
    $digest = $context->digest();
    $string = $context->hexdigest();

    $digest = MD5->hash(SCALAR);
    $string = MD5->hexhash(SCALAR);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<MD5> module allows you to use the RSA Data Security Inc. MD5
Message Digest algorithm from within Perl programs.

A new MD5 context object is created with the B<new> operation.
Multiple simultaneous digest contexts can be maintained, if desired.
The context is updated with the B<add> operation which adds the
strings contained in the I<LIST> parameter. Note, however, that
C<add('foo', 'bar')>, C<add('foo')> followed by C<add('bar')> and
C<add('foobar')> should all give the same result.

The final message digest value is returned by the B<digest> operation
as a 16-byte binary string. This operation delivers the result of
B<add> operations since the last B<new> or B<reset> operation. Note
that the B<digest> operation is effectively a destructive, read-once
operation. Once it has been performed, the context must be B<reset>
before being used to calculate another digest value.

Several convenience functions are also provided. The B<addfile>
operation takes an open file-handle and reads it until end-of file in
1024 byte blocks adding the contents to the context. The file-handle
can either be specified by name or passed as a type-glob reference, as
shown in the examples below. The B<hexdigest> operation calls
B<digest> and returns the result as a printable string of hexdecimal
digits. This is exactly the same operation as performed by the
B<unpack> operation in the examples below.

The B<hash> operation can act as either a static member function (ie
you invoke it on the MD5 class as in the synopsis above) or as a
normal virtual function. In both cases it performs the complete MD5
cycle (reset, add, digest) on the supplied scalar value. This is
convenient for handling small quantities of data. When invoked on the
class a temporary context is created. When invoked through an already
created context object, this context is used. The latter form is
slightly more efficient. The B<hexhash> operation is analogous to
B<hexdigest>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following functions can be exported on explicit request.

=over 4

=item md5($data,...)

=item md5_hex($data,...)

=item md5_base64($data,...)

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=over 4

=item $md5 = MD5->new([$data],...)

=item $md5->add($data,...)

=item $md5->addfile($handle)

=item $md5->digest

=item $md5->hexdigest

=item $md5->b64digest

=item MD5->hash($data,...)

=item MD5->hexhash($data,...)

=back


=head1 EXAMPLES

    use MD5;
    
    $md5 = new MD5;
    $md5->add('foo', 'bar');
    $md5->add('baz');
    $digest = $md5->digest();
    
    print("Digest is " . unpack("H*", $digest) . "\n");

The above example would print out the message

    Digest is 6df23dc03f9b54cc38a0fc1483df6e21

provided that the implementation is working correctly.

Remembering the Perl motto ("There's more than one way to do it"), the
following should all give the same result:

    use MD5;
    $md5 = new MD5;

    die "Can't open /etc/passwd ($!)\n" unless open(P, "/etc/passwd");

    seek(P, 0, 0);
    $md5->reset;
    $md5->addfile(P);
    $d = $md5->hexdigest;
    print "addfile (handle name) = $d\n";

    seek(P, 0, 0);
    $md5->reset;
    $md5->addfile(\*P);
    $d = $md5->hexdigest;
    print "addfile (type-glob reference) = $d\n";

    seek(P, 0, 0);
    $md5->reset;
    while (<P>)
    {
        $md5->add($_);
    }
    $d = $md5->hexdigest;
    print "Line at a time = $d\n";

    seek(P, 0, 0);
    $md5->reset;
    $md5->add(<P>);
    $d = $md5->hexdigest;
    print "All lines at once = $d\n";

    seek(P, 0, 0);
    $md5->reset;
    while (read(P, $data, (rand % 128) + 1))
    {
        $md5->add($data);
    }
    $d = $md5->hexdigest;
    print "Random chunks = $d\n";

    seek(P, 0, 0);
    $md5->reset;
    undef $/;
    $data = <P>;
    $d = $md5->hexhash($data);
    print "Single string = $d\n";

    close(P);
